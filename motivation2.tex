\section{Drawbacks of TPMD}
\label{sec:primer}

% Since SPMD is meant to capture the power model's dependence on app usage, it should be applied to 
% each app run interval that exhibits the {\em same} component usage.
% To gain insight into the extent of such "same" component usage intervals of apps,
% we start with a study to find out  how much the GPU power models derived using TPMD vary with
% apps and app scenarios. 

% show the component power draw dependency on app usage 
% using a representative modern phone, Moto Z3,
% by performing TPMD to generate the CPU and GPU power models
% on a representative modern phone, Moto Z3.
% In particular, we discuss the four-step process of TPMD discussed in \S\ref{sec:back} for the CPU and the GPU.
For the experiments in this section,
we use the external Monsoon power monitor ~\cite{monsoonpowermonitor} to measure the phone power draw.
We keep the screen brightness level at 0 which consumes
43.21 mA, 57.58 mA, and 78.82 mA respectively for the 3 phones; and this is subtracted
from the total phone power draw measurement.
