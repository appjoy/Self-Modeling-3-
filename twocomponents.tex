\section{Why only CPU and GPU are considered?}
\label{sec:twocomponent}
As we have stated in~\S\ref{sec:motivation} modern smartphones have many components built into it.
We observe the contribution of CPU, GPU, network, media decoder power components in MotoZ3 for 10 popular Google Apps with more than 1 billion plus installs.
The findings for these apps are shown in table~\ref{tab:muti_component_analysis}.
We observe that the solution with four components is not converging.
So we choose only CPU and GPU, which are major components assuming that we can successfully model these two components and further extend it to cater more components.
