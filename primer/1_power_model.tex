\subsection{Power Model for Modern Smartphones}

The modern smartphones have came a long way, with different components which are capable of running in various power states.
This calls for a complex power model, in comparison to the pure utilization model.
We focus our attention in exploring per-component self-modeling of smartphone using CPU and GPU.
The decision of modeling only CPU and GPU was taken due to the fact that these are major energy consuming components in a modern day smartphones.

%%% Need to justify with a profiled data

% However earlier paper ~\cite{Zhang2015self} 
% observe  that this
% assumption does not hold good for multicore CPUs in modern smartphones. Even under the same frequency and
% CPU utilization, two workloads with different CPU usage patterns could
% consume significantly different amounts of energy
% The root
% cause of the estimation inaccuracy and instability come
% from multiple newly introduced CPU idle power states,
% which consume markedly different amounts of power in
% multicore CPUs. Workloads with different CPU usage
% patterns cause CPU to enter different idle power states
% during the computation, which in turn leads to different amount of CPU power consumption.
