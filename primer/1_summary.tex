\paragraph{Summary.}
The above exercise of applying TPMD to derive the CPU and GPU models for 3 phones
have two important implications.
%
(1) TPMD is a laborious time-consuming process. In-situ power modeling
such as done by SPMD will enable rapid portability of energy related software.
(2) The GPU power draw is very much dependent on app usage; different
app usage can lead to variations of the same power state that draw
different amount of power. Hence {\it any fixed GPU model derived from
running a particular microbenchmark or app is likely to have high
estimation error when it is applied for a different app run.} This
motivates the need for SPMD which is inherently app usage specific.
%
\comment{(3) Don't think this should be here. This section is about TPMD. Find where to
move it.
Since different scenarios of the same app can drive components
into different power state variations, {\it the equations from
different scenarios of the same app run should not be grouped into the
same system of equations to be fed into the solver in SPMD,} as this
defeats the app usage specificity nature of SPMD.}
